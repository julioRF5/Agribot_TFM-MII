## Mechincal Design
The designed platform aims to work on the agricultural field to collect data and does weed control operations. The mentioned scope of activities requires special specifications in the electrical and mechanical parts of the robot. The robots mechanical structure should be rigid enough to conserve all equipment undamaged in uneven grounds and adverse weather conditions.

### AgriBot CAD Model
Primary sketches and models have done in Solidworks simulation software and then developments are applied in Fusion 360 from AutoCAD. The final model is shown here.

### AgriBot Body Dimensions
AgriBots body has designed upon a basic idea to be rigid enough and flexible to be easily transportable. hence, it has a square shaped top section and two legs with 1052mm in height which each leg holds two wheels in the front and the back.

* Radius of wheels: 150mm
* Height: 1052mm
* Width: 1000mm
* Length: 1080 (or 1170mm in center-to-center of wheels)
* Wright: about 35kg
