### About AgriBot's Rear Actators 

AgriBot is equipped with two servos at the rear wheels which is servo controls the orientation of one of the wheels based on commands received from the motion controller node.  The motion controller is running under base_controller package.

</div>

### Electrical Connection to System

In AgriBot, there are tow units which are operated based on *Embedded-ROS* which officially its called (Ros-Serial)[http://wiki.ros.org/rosserial ]. Servo controller module uses a *Arduino-Uno* board to controll the actuators via stepper drivers. The connection used in this section is shown in image below:

<div align="center"><img src="/doc/images/servocont.png" alt="servocon" width="700" title="servocon"/></div>

* As shown in the image the some I/O pins are used to connect the stepper driver to the Arduino board which uses I/O pins listed in table below along with their functionality .

| Pins in Arduino  | Functionality | Connected to | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| 13  | LED | I/O  |
| A0  | Pin Num.2  | ADC - Left Potentiometer  |
| A1  | Pin Num.2  | ADC - right Potentiometer  |
| 5  | PUL | I/O  |
| 10  | DIR  | I/O |
| 6  | PUL  | I/O |
| 11  | DIR  | I/O  |

* Pin-out of *Arduino-Uno* and Schematic of Stepper-Driver  can be found here:

#### Serial to USB Converter
USB/Serial Converter Turns a USB connection to the 5V TX and RX Arduino requires to communicate. This board converts a USB connection to the 5V TX and RX an Arduino requires for communication. You can connect straight to the Arduino Mini or other micro-controllers, allowing them to talk to the computer.

### About the *agribot_servo* package (Embedded-ROS)

**`NOTE`**
In case which you want to access the IMU data via using AgriBot local processor, you can skip next part and jump to [How to launch *agribot_imu*](https://github.com/PRBonn/agribot/blob/master/doc/api/agribot_imu.md#how-to-launch-agribot_imu).

In case you want to use the IMU module with another PC, please follow these steps:

1. Connect the module via Micro-USB  cable to PC.
2. Check the Com-Port name in:
```
$ cd /dev/ &
$ ls 
```
based on the name you find, using above command, change the Com-Port name in file 'servo.launch'.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<launch>
  <node pkg="rosserial_python" type="serial_node.py" name="agribot_servo">
    <param name="port" value="/dev/servo"/>
  </node>
</launch>
```
Now you're ready to launch the node. please keep no the tutorials.

**`NOTE`**
if after launching the robot base controller you get any error like:

```xml
[ERROR] [1549010158.867290]: Unable to sync with device; possible link problem or link software version mismatch such as hydro rosserial_python with groovy Arduino
```
don't pay attention to it, this is a unsolved package issue from the main developers, but the robot will work without any problem. its recommanded to check th topics to make sure of working fine, too.
